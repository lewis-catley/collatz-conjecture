# Collatz Conjecture

Just a lil bit of fun

## Challenge

There is an unproven mathematical conjecture called The Collatz Conjecture. It's simple and my 11 year old understands it (but can't prove it!!).

The conjecture goes like this:
1. Choose any whole number greater than zero
2. If the number is even then divide by two
3. If the number is odd then multiply by 3 and add 1
4. Repeat from step 2

Your challenge (if you choose to accept it), is to write the fastest code to check all the numbers from 1 to 100,000,000.
